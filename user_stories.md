# User Stories
- As the marketing research team, I want to see the number of times an image is clicked and showed on the page in order to make essential marketing decisions.

- As a developer, I want to build a program that selects three random photos from the image directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window so that users can choose between the photos.

- As a developer, I want to be able to receive clicks on those displayed images, and track those clicks for each image. I also want to track how many times each image is displayed, for statistical purposes.

- As a developer, I want these images to be non-duplicating while on the page, or the page before so that the user gets more variety per click.

- As a developer, I want to use a constructor function to create all these image objects in order to easily access and update all the variables and show off some object oriented programming concepts.

- As a developer, the constructor functions at a minimum will contain properties for the name of the image (to be used for display purposes), its filepath, the number of times it has been shown, and the number of times it has been clicked in order to satisfy coding needs.

- As a developer, I want to disable all event listeners after 25 selections have been made in order to be able to notify focus group members that they have completed the event.

- As a focus group member, I want to see a fully functional user interface that is easy to navigate in order to efficiently participate in the focus group.
